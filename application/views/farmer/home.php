						<h2 class="mb-3">Organic farming</h2>
            <p> organic farming, agricultural system that uses ecologically based pest controls and biological fertilizers derived largely from 
                animal and plant wastes and nitrogen-fixing cover crops. Modern organic farming was developed as a response to the environmental 
                harm caused by the use of chemical pesticides and synthetic fertilizers in conventional agriculture, and it has numerous ecological 
                benefits.

						<h2 class="mb-3">Organic Farming Methods</h2>
                <p>Organic farmers grow robust crops without using toxic and persistent pesticides, herbicides, fertilizers or GMOs. They do this by 
                building up the soil with natural inputs and managing weeds and pests through cultivation, biological controls (such as pest predators), 
                and diverse crop rotations.
                <br>
                They raise healthy livestock without growth hormones, antibiotics or slaughter by-products. Instead, they provide organic feed, verdant 
                pastures, and ample living room. Organically raised animals are allowed to behave naturally, which reduces stress and encourages strong 
                immune systems.
                <br>               
                Organic farmers proactively manage their fields, continuously building organic matter and improving the condition of the soil. Tools of 
                the trade include cover crops, crop rotations, animal manures, and compost. Natural, mined rocks, such as lime, also can be used to 
                balance the soil.
                <br>            
                Balanced, living soils produce healthy crops with minimal disease and insect problems, and support strong livestock. The result is 
                nutritious, good-tasting, health-promoting food, and nontoxic fiber for clothing and other textiles.

                          <h2 class="mb-3">Advantages of Organic Farmings</h2>
              <p>Compared with conventional agriculture, organic farming uses fewer pesticides, reduces soil erosion, decreases nitrate leaching into groundwater 
                and surface water, and recycles animal wastes back into the farm. These benefits are counterbalanced by higher food costs for consumers and 
                generally lower yields. Indeed, yields of organic crops have been found to be about 25 percent lower overall than conventionally grown crops, 
                although this can vary considerably depending upon the type of crop. The challenge for future organic agriculture will be to maintain its environmental 
                benefits, increase yields, and reduce prices while meeting the 
                challenges of climate change and an increasing world population.

						<h2 class="mb-3">Organic foods is good for your health</h2>
            <p1>Organic products reduce public health risks to farm workers, their families, and consumers by minimizing their exposure 
              to toxic and persistent chemicals on the farm and in food, the soil in which they work and play, the air they breathe, 
              and the water they drink. Children are especially vulnerable to pesticides. Thus, offering organic food and fiber products 
              into the marketplace gives parents the option of choosing products produced without the use of these toxins. <br>

              Not only does organic production help reduce public health risks, mounting evidence shows that food grown organically 
              are rich in nutrients, such as Vitamin C, iron, magnesium, and phosphorus, with less exposure to nitrates and pesticide 
              residues in organically grown fruits, vegetables, and grains when compared to conventionally grown products.</p>
